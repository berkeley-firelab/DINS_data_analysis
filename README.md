# DINS Data Preparation


This repository contains scripts for data preprocessing and preparation, organized under the "data_pre-processing" workflow. Additionally, the Feature Importance and SHAP analysis scripts are located in the "FI_and_SHAP_final" directory.

## Data

* `dins` 2017-2022: This is the original dataset containing string values.
* `WUI_fires`: This directory contains pre-processed and original datasets for five WUI fires with NaN values. 

## dins and WUI datasets dictionary 
#### Categorical Variables: `DAMAGE`, `ROOFCONSTRUCTION`, `EXTERIORSIDING`, `WINDOWPANE`, `EAVES`, `VENTSCREEN`, `DECK/PORCH ON GRADE`, `DECKPORCHELEVATED`, `PATIOCOVER`, `FENCE`, `VSD`
#### Numerical Variables: `Distance`, `YEARBUILT`, `ZIPCODE`, `EMBER`, `FLAME`
#### `dins`
* `DAMAGE`: ['Inaccessible', 'No Damage', 'Affected (1-9%)', 'Minor (10-25%)', 'Major (26-50%)', 'Destroyed (>50%)']
* `ROOFCONSTRUCTION`: ['Unknown', 'Fire Resistant', 'Metal', 'Concrete', 'Tile', 'Asphalt', 'Other', 'Wood', 'Combustible']
* `EXTERIORSIDING`: ['Unknown', 'Metal', 'Stucco Brick Cement', 'Stucco/Brick/Cement', 'Ignition Resistant', 'Fire Resistant', 'Vinyl', 'Other', 'Combustible','Wood']
* `WINDOWPANE`: ['Unknown', No Windows', 'Single Pane', 'Multi Pane']
* `EAVES`: ['Unknown', 'Not Applicable', 'No Eaves', 'Unenclosed', â€˜'Enclosed']
* `VENTSCREEN`: ['Unknown', 'Screened', 'Mesh Screen <= 1/8"', 'Mesh Screen > 1/8"', 'Unscreened', 'No Vents']
* `DECK/PORCH ON GRADE`: ['Unknown', 'No Deck/Porch', 'Masonry/Concrete', 'Composite', 'Wood']
* `DECKPORCHELEVATED`: ['Unknown', 'No Deck/Porch', 'Masonry/Concrete', 'Composite', 'Wood']
* `PATIOCOVER (PATIOCOVERCARPORT)`: ['Unknown', 'No Patio Cover/Carport', 'Non Combustible', 'Combustible']
* `FENCE (FENCEATTACHEDTOSTRUCTURE)`:['Unknown', 'No Fence', 'Non Combustible', 'Combustible']
* `Distance`: Structure Separation Distance (SSD) in *feet*, Using the building footprints data set, the distance from one structure to its nearest neighboring structure is measured with the QGIS tools.
* `YEARBUILT`: Year that primary structure in parcel was constructed
* `ZIPCODE`: Zip Code

#### `WUI fires`
In addition to the `dins` variables, we also have `VSD`, `EMBER`, and `FLAME` for our WUI fires:
* `VSD`: Vegetation Separation Distance or Defensible Space is the minimum distance measured from a structure to surrounding vegetation (Through an airborn LiDAR data for Sonoma County as well as Aerial/Street View Imagery). Zone 0= (0-5ft), Zone 1= (5-30ft), Zone 2= (30-100ft), and +100ft 

* `EMBER and FLAME`= Generated by the WUI model

## assets

* The primary workflow for data preprocessing can be found in the "data_pre-processing" directory.
* Feature Importance and SHAP analysis scripts are available in the "FI_and_SHAP_final" directory.

## Workflow Types

Two types of workflows are provided:

* `ipyn`: Jupyter Notebook-based workflow.
* `py`: Python script-based workflow.
